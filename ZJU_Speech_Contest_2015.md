Social Networking, Good or Bad?
===

In my humble opinion, social networking is good. It may be rash(?) to draw this conclusion immediately, but it is perfectly reasonable and obvious based on my rich experience on the social networks.

As a fanatic and pioneer user of the Internet, I started to use social networks very early. In 2006 when I for the first time purchased my own internet service, I registered QQ, and contact with my classmantes through it. The next summer vacation, I started to use baidu tieba.




When I started to use Twitter, there was no Sina Weibo. I was among the very first users of Sina Weibo.


Recently I have started to use GitHub. (Actually the draft for this very speech competition is completed on my GitHub. (This does not seem very relevant)) GitHub is a social network for programmers. There you can share the code you write, keep track of your progerss, which other can see. They can also follow you, fork your projects, edit it and send you request for merging their edits. Since it was founded in ???, numerous great projects(, like node.js, and the great Linux kernel?) have been hosted on it. It perfectly matches the spirit of opensource.


During these years, I find it an extremely convenient, possibly even the sole way to meet and contact with people from all over the world, at least for an ordinary person like me.
